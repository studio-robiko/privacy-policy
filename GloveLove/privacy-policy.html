    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> GloveLove does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Your privacy is fully protected.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        GloveLove ("we," "our," or "the app") is an educational sticker application designed to promote safe sex awareness and LGBTQ+ inclusivity through expressive messaging stickers.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our approach to data handling.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>We do not collect any data.</strong> GloveLove operates entirely offline and does not:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collect personal information</li>
        <li>Track user behavior</li>
        <li>Access device sensors or location</li>
        <li>Require account creation or login</li>
        <li>Connect to external servers</li>
        <li>Use analytics or advertising SDKs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        GloveLove only requests permissions necessary for core functionality:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save stickers locally on your device for sharing via messaging apps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        No data is transmitted outside your device. All stickers are bundled within the app.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        GloveLove does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Messaging App Integration</h2>
    <p>
        GloveLove allows you to share stickers via popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, and others. When you share stickers, they are handled by the respective app's privacy policy. GloveLove only provides the sticker files — we do not access, monitor, or store your conversations.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Age Requirement</h2>
    <p>
        GloveLove is designed for users aged 16 and above due to its sexual health education content. The app is not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect data from any user, regardless of age, as we do not collect any data at all.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Educational Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        GloveLove is intended as an educational tool to promote:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Safe sex practices and sexual health awareness</li>
        <li>LGBTQ+ inclusivity and pride</li>
        <li>Open, positive communication about relationships</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The stickers are designed for lighthearted, expressive communication and should be used responsibly.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
